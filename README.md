# time_series_predictions
In this repo I have set up a couple of different time series models to predict CPI in the US. Starting with simple forward projection of last point and with trend, we add ARIMA and VAR models to end up with a recurrent neural network that performs very well and can handle multivariate non-linear complexity in the data.
